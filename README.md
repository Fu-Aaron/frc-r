# FRC R
Playing around with R to look at some FRC data, using the The Blue Alliance csv data dumps from github.com/the-blue-alliance/the-blue-alliance-data/

I've been using R for Data Science to learn R, which is available online for free at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

## Example
Here's the type of stuff this makes pretty easy!

![Rookie Teams by Country](https://github.com/gregmarra/frc-r/blob/master/rookies_by_country.png "Rookie Teams by Country")

![Match Score Distribution](https://github.com/gregmarra/frc-r/blob/master/2017_score_distribution.png "Match Score Distribution")
